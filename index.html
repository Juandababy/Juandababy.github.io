    <ul>
      <li><em>1963</em> Michael Jordan,born on February 17, 1963, Brooklyn,New York American collegiate and professional basketball player widely considered to be one of the greatest all-around players in the history of the game.</li>

      <li><em>1989</em> Michael Jordan's 1989 playoff run is underrated as hell.Jordan averaged an absurd 39.8ppg, 5.8rpg, 8.2apg and 3spg in the series. This was also the series he hit 'The Shot' over Craig Ehlo. Chicago then went on to upset the second-seeded Knicks in the second round, winning the series in six games.</li>
      <li><em>1990</em> Jordan stayed in beast mode, but he seemingly took things to a new level in 1990-91. Averaging 31.5 points, 6.0 rebounds and 5.5 assists a game that year, he was also only the second player in history to win Most Valuable Player for the regular season, the Finals and the All-Star game, on top of also earning a title.</li>
      <li><em>1991</em> With a 108-101 score, the Bulls claimed victory of Game 5 and 4-1 of the 1991 NBA Finals. Having averaged 31.2 points, 6.6 rebounds, 11.4 assists, and 2.8 steals per game, 28-year-old Jordan pocketed his first NBA championship after seven years. He held the trophy with two arms, crying like a child in the locker room.</li>
      <li><em>1992</em> The Play: Michael Jordan keys a 57-23 run that starts late in the second quarter, putting on one of the most dazzling individual performances in Finals history. He buried the Portland Trail Blazers with a barrage of 3-pointers, a then-record six in the first half, as the Chicago Bulls pulled away. </li>
      <li><em>1993</em> A portion of ESPN's Michael Jordan documentary series will focus on the Chicago Bulls legend's decision in 1993 to retire from professional basketball at the peak of his playing career, shocking the sports world in the process. Jordan was just 30 years old when he announced his decision to retire on Oct. 6, 1993.</li>
      <li><em>1996</em> It began and ended on July 10, 1996. The lockout was imposed after the league and the players union could not reach an agreement involving $50 million in profit sharing from television revenue.</li>
      <li><em>1997</em> In the six years that the Bulls won NBA Championships, the 1997â€“98 season featured Jordan's lowest per-game numbers in points 28.7, assists 3.5, rebounds 5.8, steals 1.7 and blocks 0.5.</li>
      <li><em>1998</em> Jordan finished the playoffs with an average of 32.4 points per game on 46.2 percent shooting from the field, 30.2 percent from the 3-point line and 81.2 percent from the free throw line, giving him a true shooting percentage of 54.5, which was slightly better than what he posted in the regular season.</li>
      <li><em>2009</em> The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is pleased to announce that Michael Jordan, David Robinson, Jerry Sloan, John Stockton, and C. Vivian Stringer have been named today as the Enshrinement Class of 2009.</li>
